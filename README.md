# Train-Scheduler
This application allows you to enter in a TRAIN NAME / DESTINATION / FIRST DEPARTURE TIME / FREQUENCY OF TRAIN IN MIN.

It then takes this information & calculates & displays when the next train will arrive & how many minutes away the train is. The Train Name, Destination, & Frequency are displayed as well.

The application utilizes a Firebase Database to save the train details in order for multiple users to see the same information on the page, as well as the train info persisting until the train is removed from the database.
